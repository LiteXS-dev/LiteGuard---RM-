ðŸš¨ LiteGuard â€” Coming Soon! ðŸš¨

/THE INFO IF IT WILL COST MONEY IS UNKNOWN, YET\

After working on LiteGuard since 2022 (about 6 hours a day, every day), Iâ€™m excited to announce it will be releasing very soon!

What LiteGuard is

A kernel-level anticheat built for reliability and low overhead designed to detect and stop cheats deeper in the system while remaining lightweight for players.

Backend and telemetry are hosted on secure servers in Switzerland, so user data is stored under strong Swiss data protection practices and kept private and safe.

Focused on performance, accuracy, and respecting user privacy.

Why it matters

Kernel-level protection lets LiteGuard catch cheaters that other solutions miss.

Swiss-hosted servers mean data is handled with high legal protections and strong privacy norms.

Built from the ground up with stability and minimal impact on gameplay.

Stay tuned. Iâ€™ll share release details, FAQs, and how to get LiteGuard as soon as everythingâ€™s ready.
